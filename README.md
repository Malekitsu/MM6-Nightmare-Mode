# MM6-Nightmare-Mode
Extra encounters, extra events, extra difficulty;

Just copy paste this in your MM6 folder with MAW mod istalled.

The game will crash if you enter/load into a dungeon entered before before installing this mod.

An easy fix is to open MM6.ini and set "GlobalMapResetDays=default" to "GlobalMapResetDays=0". Enter the game (will reset the dungeon), save, set back to default and play.
